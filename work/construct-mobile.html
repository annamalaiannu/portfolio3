          <p class="body-text-1">With our users expecting to do an increasing number of things on the mobile app, inconsistencies started to creep in, in both the flow and information architecture. We had to craft a more accessible, understandable app that affords all of Construct’s existing features in a consistent, logical and coherent manner.<br><br>Over time, the demands of the Construct app have grown exponentially. What started as a tool for managing tasks, updating drawings and recording daily logs, must now meet the needs of on-site workers across cities, in different situations – responding to schedule update requests, conducting inspections during different phases of a project, raising safety observations or even recording the observed weather conditions. Construct was being used for a variety of things that were never imagined at its inception. We worked closely with our PMs and on-site teams both in India and the US, to design a better app. <br><br>Here&#x27;s how we went about redesigning one feature specifically, observations.</p>

      <p class="project-body-paragraph-1"><strong> Our users were hesitant to fill out forms on mobile</strong>. Users were finding it hard to do simple tasks such as creating and editing an observation. They found interacting with the app very taxing. In our research phase, our data was telling us that<strong> observations feature wasn&#x27;t being explored</strong>. So, our goal was to make the process of filling out a form as easy as possible. We looked to avoid clutter and <strong>build on existing mental models of our users. </strong></p>

            <p class="project-body-paragraph-1">Our users were spending <strong>more than 7 seconds</strong> to simply understand the form while creating an observation and <strong>over 400 seconds</strong> to complete the process. They found it complex and unintuitive.<br><br>We heard users tell us that they were not finding particular fields / calls-to-action, when in fact they were present. Often they had to return to the form, since they <strong>missed certain details.</strong></p>

            <p class="project-body-paragraph-1">We realised our users were scanning instead of reading. The first thing users did when they saw the form was, estimate how long it would take to complete it. <strong>Perception was crucial, </strong><strong>when they saw too many fields, they were quick to abandon the process.</strong></p>

            <p class="project-body-paragraph-1">The old design presented all the fields stacked one below the other. The <strong>lack of hierarchy and structure</strong> and an increasing number of fields, made the form difficult to comprehend. The mental and physical load on the user were too high.</p>

        <li class="takeaway-1">“<strong>The more you know your user the better the design will be.</strong>” This quote sums up my experience rather nicely. I learnt that both <strong>information design is very interdisciplinary</strong>. <strong>I learnt that it always started with the user.</strong></li>
        <li class="takeaway-1">While working on this redesign, I tried to have a dialog with the data; <strong>Poking at it, looking at it from different perspectives with users.</strong> We tried a number of ways to visualise the information, until we stumbled upon one way that made sense and was most useful to the user.</li>
        <li class="takeaway-1">Here are some questions we kept asking ourselves,<br><em class="italic-text-2">What works visually?<br>What works from a design perspective &amp; usability standpoint?<br>Which way tells a story?<br>Which way is it most helpful to the user?<br>Are we using people language?</em></li>
