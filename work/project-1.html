As the lead UX designer for Vookmark, I was responsible for the full design effort, including the website, mobile app, internal dashboards, blog, social media, and the pitch deck.<br><br>This article is a brief overview of how we went about building Vookmark.</div>

        <h3>Should we build Vookmark in the first place?</h3>
        <p>To validate this question we went around getting the perspective of friends and colleagues in our office. <strong>We were quick to realise that our potential target audience wasn&#x27;t very different from us.We wanted to dig into the information in and around us.</strong> After a few informal talks across teams, we realised that through Vookmark, we were addressing an actual user need, that many of us within the office faced.<br><br>At different points during the day, a majority of us were watching videos on Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo and even Reddit. And often there was always at least one interesting video we really wanted to watch but couldn&#x27;t, during the course of the day and then we&#x27;d forget it completely.<br><br>‍</p>
        <h3>Deciding on the initial Feature Set: What should the app do?</h3>
        <p>Some of the initial questions we had,</p>
        <ol start="1" role="list">
          <li>What should the landing page look like? Should it be a feed?</li>
          <li>How does the user discover new content?</li>
          <li>Would the user like to categorise videos? Would a tag based approach add value?</li>
          <li>Should the user be able to create and share video playlists?</li>
          <li>What happens when the user shares a bookmarked (<strong>or vookmarked ;)</strong>) video to a non-Vookmark user? Should we prompt him to download the app to view it?<br></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before deciding what to build we wanted to ensure that we didn’t get lost on a tangent and forget the pain-point we were trying address.</p>
        <h5><br>We decided to focus on the main pain-points<br></h5>
        <ul start="1" role="list">
          <li>How do we make booking marking videos convenient and seamless?</li>
          <li>How do we get users into the habit of bookmarking videos?</li>
          <li>How do we remind the user that he can always vookmark the video without distracting him from the streaming experience?</li>
          <li>How do we make the experience personalised?</li>
          <li>We decided to keep the landing page simple. On opening the app the user would see his list of bookmarked videos.</li>

        <h3>How should the user bookmark videos across platforms and across devices to watch later?</h3>
        <p>Through testing a range of medium-fidelity prototypes, we started understanding what the ideal process to bookmark videos should be.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h4>Bookmarking videos on the web</h4>
        <p>On the web, the user would first have to download the browser extension to start saving videos. After the extension is installed, the user can save videos by clicking on the <strong>Vookmark button or icon.</strong><br>‍</p>
        <h4>Bookmarking videos on mobile/iPad</h4>
        <p>On mobile, the user would be able to save videos by tapping on the <strong>Vookmark icon on the share sheet.<br>‍</strong></p>

      <ul role="list">
        <li class="body-1"><strong>A mobile first approach - </strong>After our initial release we had users asking us on why we didn&#x27;t have a web app. In retrospect, not having the web app as part of our initial release was a mistake. We went in with a mobile-first approach. <strong>This meant that while users would be able to bookmark videos on both the web and mobile, they would have to switch back to their phones or tablets to watch the videos.</strong></li>
        <li class="body-1"><strong>Ability to bookmark on right click - </strong>Users wanted to have the option to bookmark videos on right-click. Luckily for us our web app was only a week away from its release and a minor tweak was enough to allow users to save videos on right-click.</li>
