          <p class="body-text-1">Prior to Scheduler, our Project managers scrambled between a bunch of planning software, spreadsheets, docs and emails to create project launches. There were too many separate pieces to connect, fit together, and update. A lot of time was spent managing the schedule even when actual work started. Project managers had to manage the details rather than on strategy.<br>Looking at the data and talking to PMs, made it clear that a lot of them were scrambling across applications to create a schedule. They needed a simple way to plan a schedule, assign tasks and allocate resources.</p>

      <h5 class="h2"><strong>Activity List</strong></h5>
      <p class="paragraph">The users needed a view that allowed them to track every detail of every task or activity. They needed a single source of truth. The key challenge for me was to accommodate all the data points without losing the simplicity and scannability. I took special care to ensure that the important data points stood out.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">We introduced <strong>Activity Templates</strong>, to allow users to quickly start mapping out a project plan or schedule. After importing the template, he can customise it any which way.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">I added visual cues where necessary to make each detail stand out. Since every field was meaningful and had to be incorporated, <strong>getting the visual hierarchy right was crucial</strong>. I introduced icons where possible to reduce the clutter and make the page more breathable and scannable.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">While PMs wanted a powerful view with the ability to track every detail, our other user group - clients and senior managers - wanted a simple visual overview of the project as a whole across departments, with the ability to dive into detail if needed.<br>One insight I held onto while working on this page was that, managers were looking to explore and find something interesting from the data. They were not looking to confirm what they already knew but to find what they missed.</p>
