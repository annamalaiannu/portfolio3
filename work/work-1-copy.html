              Vookmark was built in-house by NFN Labs. I was apart of the team
              right from day 1, when we were dabbling with the idea of building
              this product in the first place. As the lead UX designer for
              Vookmark, I was responsible for the full design effort, including
              the website, mobile app, internal dashboards, blog, social media,
              and the pitch deck.<br /><br />This article is a brief overview of
              how we went about building Vookmark.

            The internet is full of fascinating videos, most of which you really
            don’t have time for or shouldn’t be looking at during your workday.
            Most of us save such content as to our browsers (as favourites),
            email them to ourselves or keep way too many tabs open. And then we
            just forget about them altogether. We don’t get back to them.<br />

          <p class="project-body-paragraph-1">
            This question came up during an all-hands session on a Monday
            morning. We did a quick pulse check and the team was pretty quite
            confident. We got a rough ball-park estimate from our seasoned
            in-house dev team.<br />

            Just because we can, doesn’t mean we should. To build or not to
            build? To validate this question we went around getting the
            perspective of friends and colleagues in our office. We were quick
            to realise that our potential target audience weren’t very different
            from people around us and our immediate circle of friends. We wanted
            to dig into the information in and around us. After a few informal
            talks across teams, we realised that we were addressing an actual
            user need, that many of us within the office faced.<br />

          A lot of the people we interviewed said at different points during the

          Reddit. And there was always at least one video they really wanted to
          watch but couldn’t , during the course of the day. And then they never
          got back to it altogether.

            the user can save videos by clicking on the
            <strong>Vookmark button or icon next to the video title.</strong

            <strong>A mobile first approach - </strong>After our initial release
            we had users asking us on why we didn&#x27;t have a web app. In
            retrospect, not having the web app as part of our initial release
            was a mistake. We went in with a mobile-first approach. This meant
            that while users would be able to bookmark videos on both the web
            and mobile, they would have to switch back to their phones or
            tablets to watch the videos.

            <strong>Ability to bookmark on right click - </strong>Users wanted
            to have the option to bookmark videos on right-click. Luckily for us
            our web app was only a week away from its release and a minor tweak
            was enough to allow users to save videos on right-click.

            Looking back, Vookmark was a huge learning for me.<strong>
              The sheer amount of knowledge I gained within a few months was
              humbling.</strong

            <strong>There were a lot of firsts for me</strong>  -  from wearing
            the hat of a design lead to designing content for social media to
            <strong>seeing how design decisions impact business. </strong>
