Katerra aims to help transform construction through technology—every process and every product.<br><br>And Apollo is a huge part of this vision. Apollo is a software platform and suite of applications designed to support building projects and teams from beginning to end. While building Apollo, the focus was primarily of tech and business goals of Katerra. Katerra found itself in need of a design overhaul. My job was to create a unified design language to modernize IBM&#x27;s enterprise software.<br><br>With even the most complex domains of industries starting to embrace technology, Katerra was looking for new ways to take their digital offering to the next level, with an experience crafted around the user.</p>         </div>       </div>     </div>   </div>   <div id="Section-1" class="scheduler-feature-1">     <div class="container-3 w-container">       <h5 class="h2"><strong>How we got here</strong></h5>       <p class="paragraph">In 2018, I started working at Katerra Technologies, Katerra&#x27;s software wing which was responsible for the tech.  I came onboard as a contractor, responsible for the product design of the Apollo mobile app. Katerra didn&#x27;t have a full-time product design team. The Apollo team was in a phase of transition. It was a time when the product team was just starting to recognize the value of user experience, thanks to some early feedback from real users. Prior to this the team was focused on solutions that technically work and met Katerra’s business objectives. There was no product design team in place.</p>       <p class="paragraph">The designs we shipped for mobile proved to be a gentle introduction to user experience. Soon I got pulled into every product in the Katerra’s Apollo suite and became a full time member of Katerra. I was asked to provide quick incremental UX tweaks and make workflows simpler. Product teams starting to realise that the designs can be improved was an important step.</p>     </div>   </div>   <div id="Section-1" class="scheduler-feature-1">     <div class="container-3 w-container">       <h5 class="h2"><strong>Breaking old habits formed in the absence of good design</strong></h5>       <p class="paragraph">Products in the Apollo suite were stuck in a 90’s theme that we desperately needed to get out of. A lot of the patterns and interactions were out of date. The entire architecture was tangled, navigating across apps was unnecessarily complex. Workflows didn&#x27;t function the way our users expected. Soon it was quite evident that we needed a complete revamp.<br><strong>There was no brand identity, nothing uniquely Apollo</strong> - no defined color palette, typography, consistent iconography etc. Developers looked to reuse existing elements and widgets wherever possible, leaving product designers completely out of the picture. <strong>We had to craft a product agnostic design language which was cohesive and uniquely Apollo.</strong></p>       <div><img src="../images/2-DS---Old-UI.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 688px, 900px" srcset="../images/2-DS---Old-UI-p-500.png 500w, ../images/2-DS---Old-UI-p-800.png 800w, ../images/2-DS---Old-UI.png 1000w" alt=""></div>       <p class="paragraph"><br><strong>Apollo 1.0 was plagued with inconsistency and stuck in a 90&#x27;s theme. </strong>Features were built as one-off solutions without a common language.

It’s impossible to create a great design from the first attempt. In December 2019, we kicked off our first real effort to align product design and standardise components across products. We decided to build an MVP of some sort, a minimum viable design system.  We had a small multidisciplinary team (2 designers, 1 PO, 1 PM &amp; 1 VP). <br><br>Since the team never really paid attention to design issues in the past, there were some glaring issues that we could easily fix. We identified base components such as data tables, input boxes, calls-to-action etc and formalised how these components looked and behaved. Out of these components we built a base component library and tested it out on Katerra&#x27;s budgeting software. We had team members gather together on informal design reviews to discuss the pros and cons of individual solutions. This was a huge effort in itself. This effort also helped us better estimate the effort a complete revamp would take and how to go about it.<br></p>       <div><img src="../images/3-DS---Component-Library.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 688px, 900px" srcset="../images/3-DS---Component-Library-p-500.png 500w, ../images/3-DS---Component-Library-p-800.png 800w, ../images/3-DS---Component-Library-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/3-DS---Component-Library-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/3-DS---Component-Library.png 1767w" alt="" class="image-7">         <p class="paragraph"><strong>This step was crucial for us to get organizational buy-in. </strong>It taught us the basics and strategy - to gather and document opinions, reach out to a diverse team and collect as many opinions as early as possible, and have senior members at the right moments to get feedback when it mattered the most.
